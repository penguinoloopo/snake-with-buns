    <p>Watch out when grabbing a bun. You don't want to fall victim to snake with buns!
    Some qualities of snake with buns include:</p>

    <ul>
    	<li>long</li>
    	<li>scary</li>
    	<li>snake</li>
    	<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BreadStapledToTrees/"">buns</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Because of these, snake with buns is not a force to be reckoned with! It is up to you
    to decide whether or not the buns are truly worth the risk. (I'd say it is)</p>
